# 9. Consider the USArrests data. We will now perform hierarchical clustering
# on the states.



# (a) Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and
# Euclidean distance, cluster the states.



# (b) Cut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct
# clusters. Which states belong to which clusters?



# (c) Hierarchically cluster the states using complete linkage and Euclidean
# distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation
# one.



# (d) What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical
# clustering obtained? In your opinion, should the variables be
# scaled before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed?
#   Provide a justification for your answer.
